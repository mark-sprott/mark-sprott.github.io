      <h2>What did I think about meditation prior to reading chapter 2 of Searh inside yourself?</h2
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>I found this chapter very interesting.  I have been doing meditation on a regular basis for a couple of months using the 'Headspace app'  which I have downloaded onto my phone.  I find that doing regular meditation has been very beneficial for me, in both my work and personal life.  It is something that I look forward to each morning, and a great way to start the day</p>
      <h2>What new things have I learnt about meditation?</h2>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>Over the last couple of months I have learnt so much about meditation.</p>
      <p>My ability to stay focused on things has improved greatly.  I have found this very beneficial to my study, but also when having conversations with people, the ability to stay focused and remain present has been very beneficial and exciting</p>
