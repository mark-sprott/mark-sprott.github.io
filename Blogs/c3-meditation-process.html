      <h3>What did I think about meditation prior to reading chapter 2 of Searh inside yourself?</h3>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>I found this chapter very interesting.  I have been doing meditation on a regular basis for a couple of months using the 'Headspace app'  which I have downloaded onto my phone.</p>
      <p>I find that doing regular meditation has been very beneficial for me, in both my work and personal life.  It is something that I look forward to each morning, and a great way to start the day</p>
