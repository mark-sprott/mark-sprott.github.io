      <h2>What did I think about meditation prior to reading chapter 2 of Searh inside yourself?</h2
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>I found this chapter very interesting.  I have been doing meditation on a regular basis for a couple of months using the 'Headspace app'  which I have downloaded onto my phone.  I find that doing regular meditation has been very beneficial for me, in both my work and personal life.  It is something that I look forward to each morning, and a great way to start the day.</p>
      <h2>What new things have I learnt about meditation?</h2>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>Over the last couple of months I have learnt so much about meditation.</p>
      <p>My ability to stay focused on things has improved greatly.  I have found this very beneficial to my study, but also when having conversations with people, the ability to stay focused and remain present has been very beneficial and exciting.</p>
      <h2>Meditation techniques that stood out for me</h2>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>The technique that stands out the most for me is the ability to stay relaxed and alert at the same time.  This is the key to good meditation.  I would also say that meditation like most things gets better and easier with practice.</p>
      <h2>Any thing else?</h2>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>I would engourage everyone to give meditation a try.  It can seem difficult at first, but stick with it as the benefits are amazing and can be life changing.</p>
