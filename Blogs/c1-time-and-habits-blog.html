      So I found this subject very interesting, with lots of useful information and tips to help you stay focused and on target.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end I decided to pick the 3 techniques that interested me most.  The Power of Meditation, Mindfulness, and the Pomodoro Technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art of Mindfulness thinking is the subject that really interested me, and the one that I will be doing a lot more work on.  I think this way of thinking will be very beneficial for work and personal life.  However that said the Pomodoro technique has been the best technique that I have found to stay focused, and the idea of just targeting one thing for 25 minutes then taking a five minute break, and reflecting on what you achieved has been fantastic for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will continue to experiment with all these techniques in the future.
