    <h2>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MINDFULNESS AND SELF AWARENESS</h2>
    <p>MINDFULNESS is about gaining control.  It's a skill that gives you the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again.  Once we have mastered mindfullness it gives the ability to bring our attention to our own self-awareness.</p>
    <P>SELF AWARENESS is about looking within ourselves with clarity.  This helps us see our emotions the moment they arise and cease, and the subtle changes in between.  Daniel Goleman defines self-awareness as "knowing one's internal states, preferences, resources and intuitions".  Self-awareness is the key domain of emotional intelligence, it embodies - Emotional awareness: Recognizing one's emotions and their effects.  Accurate self-assessment: Knowing one's strengths and limits, and Self-confidence: A strong sense of one's self-worth and capabilities.</P>
    <p>I found the body scanning technique to be very useful.  The ability to scan ones emotions the moment they arise has been very beneficial for myself.</p>
    <p>I found the my emotions are not me section very interesting, and insightful.  I found it a great way to dis-empower your emotions and calm your mind.</p>
