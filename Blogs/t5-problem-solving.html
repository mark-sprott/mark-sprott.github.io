          <h2>Getting blocked on a simple problem</h2>
          <p>
              I have found that getting blocked on a simple problem while writing code can be very easy to do.  It can be the most simple thing to fix, but also the most frustrating thing to find.  When I come across such a problem, the first thing I like to do is try a few things myself before looking further for help.  Over the course of phase-0 I have learnt to limit the time I spend on a problem trying to fix it prior to seeking further help.  I now limit this to four or five attemps before researching over options.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first option when seeking further help is google, followed by youtube, and then I use the slackchat.  I find all of these most helpful, however there is nothing quite as satisfying as solving the problem yourself!!
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest thing that I have learnt is that it is ok to ask for or seek help from other scources.  The worst thing you can do is sit on a problem for to long as this can lead to procrastinaton, which then leads to frustration, and worse still self-doubt.  The real leason is that if you need to seek help from other scources is that you understand the code fully where you went wrong, this is something that I am still learning to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being able to solve problems using other resources such as google, youtube or your peers give you Confidence that you can solve most things easly and quickly.  The challenge is to have a go yourself prior to accessing these other avenues as you get a better understanding on how things work, when you solve them yourself.  I think it is also good to sit back and reflect at the end of each sprint.  To go over the things you could do better, but also to recongnise the things you did well.
