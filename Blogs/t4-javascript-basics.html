      <h2>HOW DOES JAVASCRIPT COMPARE TO HTML AND CSS?</h2>
      <P>HTML, is used to create the basic structure and content of a webpage.  Like the framing does in your house.</P>
      <p>CSS, is used for the design of a webpage – where everything is placed and how it looks.  So like in your house, it would mean which room is which, and what colour the walls are.</p>
      <p>JAVASCRIPT, creates interactivity!  So if we take your house it would mean that when you pushed the garage door remote button the door would go up or down.</p>
      <h3>Loops</h3>
      <p>Loops.  What is a loop?  JavaScript loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code - until a certain condition is met.  So like driving around the block time and again until a park becomes available.</p>
      <h3>WHAT IS CONTROL FLOW?</h3>
      <P>control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.  It's like a task list at work or a check list, which sets out the order in which things must be done, or in order to brush your teeth you must first put tooth paste on the tooth brush.</p>
      <h3>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCESSING DATA FROM ARRAYS AND OBJECTS.</h3>
      <P>Arrays are a special type of objects, with numbered indexes.  Arrays use numbered indexes while Objects use named indexes.</P>
      <p>You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text), and You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.</p>
      <p>You access an array element by referring to the index number.</p>
      <h3>WHAT ARE FUNCTIONS AND WHY ARE THEY USEFUL?</h3>
      <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
