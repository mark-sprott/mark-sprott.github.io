        <h2>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h2>
        <p>I have been fortunite over the past few years to have servered as a frontline firefighter with the New Zealand fire service.  During this time I have experienced pleasure, passion, and higher purpose on a number of occasions.  I think that giving everything you have to help a complete stranger is the most rewarding part of the job, and it gives you an intoxicating rush, which is hard to explain and even harder to give up (I would discribe this as the rockstar rush).  I think this is the main reason people stay in the job for so long.</p>
        <h2>What are your core values?</h2>
        <p>My core values are equality for all, love, and justice.  I am a big believer that we are all equal, and that we all have something beautiful to offer.  I like to stand up for things that I believe in, in a respectful manner.</p>
        <h2>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h2>
        <p> Prior to starting at the Dev Academy I didn't do any meditation.  Now I meditate every morning.  I am completely hooked, and I find the benefits to be so amazing for me,  and it is something that I will always do now.</p>
