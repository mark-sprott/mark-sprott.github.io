    <h2>What is a responsive website and why is it important?</h2>
        <p>Responsive Web design is an approach whereby a designer creates a Web page that “responds to” or resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being seen through.  That could be an oversized desktop computer monitor, a laptop, a 10-inch tablet, a 7-inch tablet, or a 4-inch smartphone screen.</p>
        <p>If you look at a traditional "fixed" website.  When viewed on a desktop computer, for instance, the website might show 3 columns.  But when you view that same website on a smaller tablet or smart-phone it might force you to scroll horizontally.  Which can be painful!!  Even worse some elements may be hidden from view or look distorted.  This impact is made more complicated by the fact that many tablets can be viewed either in protrait or landscape.</p>
        <p> With more and more people accessing information via their smart-phones or tablets having a responsive website has never been so important.</p>
    <h2>What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h2>
        <p>No prizes for guessing this one.  Mobile first means designing a webpage or site for mobile devices before designing for desktop or any other device.  Mobile first is an approach to responsive design: design for smaller screens first, then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens.</p>
        <p>The reason why a mobile first design is so important is because so many of us now use a mobile device to access information on the go, and for that reason, this design strateby must be given serious thought when designing a website or page.</p>
    <h2>What are frameworks and what are their Pro's and Con's</h2>
        <p>A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.</p>
        <p>Say what????  Most websites share a very similar (not to say identical) structure. The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers don’t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided. In this way, frameworks allow us to cut out much of the work and save a lot of time.</p>
