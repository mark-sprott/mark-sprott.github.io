    <h2>What is a responsive website and why is it important?</h2>
        <p>Responsive Web design is an approach whereby a designer creates a Web page that “responds to” or resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being seen through.  That could be an oversized desktop computer monitor, a laptop, a 10-inch tablet, a 7-inch tablet, or a 4-inch smartphone screen.</p>
        <p>If you look at a traditional "fixed" website.  When viewed on a desktop computer, for instance, the website might show 3 columns.  But when you view that same website on a smaller tablet or smart-phone it might force you to scroll horizontally.  Which can be painful!!  Even worse some elements may be hidden from view or look distorted.  This impact is made more complicated by the fact that many tablets can be viewed either in protrait or landscape.</p>
        <p> With more and more people accessing information via their smart-phones or tablets having a responsive website has never been so important.</p>
    <h2>What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h2>
        <p>No prizes for guessing this one.  Mobile first means designing a webpage or site for mobile devices before designing for desktop or any other device.  Mobile first is an approach to responsive design: design for smaller screens first, then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens.</p>
        <p>The reason why a mobile first design is so important is because so many of us now use a mobile device to access information on the go, and for that reason, this design strateby must be given serious thought when designing a website or page.</p>
    <h2>What are frameworks and what are their Pro's and Con's</h2>
        <p>A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.</p>
        <p>Say what????  Most websites share a very similar (not to say identical) structure. The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers don’t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided. In this way, frameworks allow us to cut out much of the work and save a lot of time.</p>
    <h3>The Pros</h3>
        <h4>EFFICIENCY</h4>
        <p>Tasks that usually would take you hours and hundreds of lines of code to write, can now be done in minutes with pre-built functions. Development becomes a lot easier, so if it’s easier it’s faster, and consequently efficient.</p>
        <h4>SECURITY<h4>
        <p>A widely used framework has big security implementations. The big advantage is the community behind it, where users become long-term testers. If you find a vulnerability or a security hole, you can go to the framework’s website and let the team know so they can fix it.</P>
        <h4>COST</h4>
        <p>Most popular frameworks are free, and since it also helps the developer to code faster, the cost for the final client will be smaller.</P>
    <h3>The Cons</h3>
        <h4>YOU LEARN THE FRAMEWORK, NOT THE LANGUAGE</h4>
        <p>If you’re using a framework and you know very little about the language behind it, you will learn the framework and not the language itself.</p>
        <h4>LIMITATION</h4>
        <p>The framework’s core behaviour can’t be modified, meaning that when you use a framework, you are forced to respect its limits and work the way it is required. So you need to make sure you choose a framework that suits your needs.</p>
        <h4>Code is public</h4>
        <p>Since the framework is available to everyone, it is also available to people with bad intentions. It can be studied in order to know how things work and to find flaws that can be used against you.</p>
