          <p>'Mindfulness conversations'.  The art of 'looping','dipping', and listening without talking is such a beautiful thing, that I encourage everyone to try it.</p>
          <h4>LOOPING</h4>
          <p>Looping is simple. and so effective.  It's a great way to make sure that you have understood what the other person has said, and it's a great chance for each party to clear up any missunderstandings prior to continuing the conversation.  It makes the person speaking feel that they have been listened to fully and that the other person is very clear about what they had to say.</p>
          <p></p>
          <h4>DIPPING</h4>
          <p>Dipping is another great tool.  Dipping during a converstaion is a way of checking in with ourselves, our feelings and internal chatter.  These things are often in reaction to what the other person has said.  The best way to respond to these internal distractions is to notice and acknowledge them.  Know they are there, but try not to judge them, and then let them go if they are willing to go.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The art of mindfulness conversation is something that I will try and continue to do at all times.  I have found all the techniques is this book so beneficial, and would encourage anyone to purchase it and follow it's teachings.</p>
