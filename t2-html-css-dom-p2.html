      <h1>WHAT IS GRID BASED DESIGN?</H1>
        <P>Grid based webpage design is a lot like playing the game battleships.  It's a lot easier to play if you have a sheet of paper with a grid drawn on it "makes it easier to position your ships". Just like laying out your webpage using a grid makes it a lot easier to position all your content.</p>
