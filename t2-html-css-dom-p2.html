      <h2>WHAT IS GRID BASED DESIGN?</h2>
        <P>Grid based webpage design is a lot like playing the game battleships.  It's a lot easier to play if you have a sheet of paper with a grid drawn on it "makes it easier to position your ships". Just like laying out your webpage using a grid makes it a lot easier to position all your content.</p>
          <p>Grids help you to achieve effective alignment and consistency with little effort. "Winging it" and relying on your gut does not scale so well. If executed properly, your designs will appear thoughtful, organized, neat and structurally sound.
Good alignment, like much of design, should almost go unnoticed by your users. Less is more.</p>
          <p>Be too clever and you risk distracting the user from their primary goal of searching for specific content and digesting it quickly. That should be your focus—not showing off how nifty you can be with your design skills. Even worse would be reinventing the wheel to proove a point. A lack of alignment is very noticeable and creates a sloppy impression. This might very well result in a lack of trust from users who consume your design—unless the lack of alignment is something you are going for on purpose for whatever creative reason.</p>
          <h2>WHAT'S ALL THIS HYPE ABOUT RESPONSIVE WEBPAGES THEN?</h2>
          <p>Well if you are managing a webpage for a buisness or a site for yourself then the HYPE is very much warranted.  Everyone (well neally everyone) wants a mobile version of their website or page.</p>
          <p>Responsive web design is an approach where the webpage and or site is able to respond to a user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.</p>
          <p>So as you can see a responsive website or page means that it does'nt matter weather you are using an Iphone, Ipad, blackberry or samsung you will always get the same veiw and usability....now that's worth a bit of HYPE I think.</p>
          <h2>WHAT IS A SEMANTIC STRUCTURE?</h2>
          <p>Semantics refers to the correct interpretation of the meaning of a word or sentence. To use a word semantically is to use it in a way that is properly aligned with the meaning of the word. When we misuse a word we are not using it semantically.</p>
          <p> Many HTML tags have semantic meaning. That is, the element itself conveys some information about the type of content contained between the opening and closing tags. For example, when a browser encounters an h1 heading it interprets that tag to mean that the contents of the h1 element constitute the most important heading of the section that contains the element. The semantic meaning of an h1 tag is that it is used to identify the most important header of a specific web page or section.</p>
          <p>So in short Semantic structure is all about using the correct tags and elements when coding, thus hopfully making it easier for anyone to interpret your coding.</p>
