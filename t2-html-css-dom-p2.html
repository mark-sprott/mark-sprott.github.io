      <h2>WHAT IS GRID BASED DESIGN?</h2>
        <P>Grid based webpage design is a lot like playing the game battleships.  It's a lot easier to play if you have a sheet of paper with a grid drawn on it "makes it easier to position your ships". Just like laying out your webpage using a grid makes it a lot easier to position all your content.</p>
          <p>Grids help you to achieve effective alignment and consistency with little effort. "Winging it" and relying on your gut does not scale so well. If executed properly, your designs will appear thoughtful, organized, neat and structurally sound.
Good alignment, like much of design, should almost go unnoticed by your users. Less is more.</p>
          <p>Be too clever and you risk distracting the user from their primary goal of searching for specific content and digesting it quickly. That should be your focus—not showing off how nifty you can be with your design skills. Even worse would be reinventing the wheel to proove a point. A lack of alignment is very noticeable and creates a sloppy impression. This might very well result in a lack of trust from users who consume your design—unless the lack of alignment is something you are going for on purpose for whatever creative reason.</p>
          <h2>WHAT'S ALL THIS HYPE ABOUT RESPONSIVE WEBPAGES THEN?</h2>
          <p>Well if you are managing a webpage for a buisness or a site for yourself then the HYPE is very much warranted.  Everyone (well neally everyone) wants a mobile version of their website or page.</p>
          <p>Responsive web design is an approach where the webpage and or site is able to respond to a user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.</p>
          <p>So as you can see a responsive website or page means that it does'nt matter weather you are using an Iphone, Ipad, blackberry or samsung you will always get the same veiw and usability....now that's worth a bit of HYPE I think.</p>
