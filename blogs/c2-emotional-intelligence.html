      Wow!  I enjoyed this chapter so much that I bought the book (after I had continued reading for another couple of chapters).

      For me the biggest learning from this chapter was being in tuning into not only your mind but also your body.  Noticing subtle changes in your body as you start to feel anger or tension or even harmony.  Learning to read these signs, giving yourself a moment to reflect on them and then deciding the best course of action (remembering also how this will make the other person feel).

      Meditation also plays a big part in mindfulness as you may expect.  I have found the Headspace app which you can download onto your Android or iPhone to be very helpful with your meditation practice, and I encourage you to have a try.

      This adventure is more a journey than a quick skim and move on, so I am looking forward to reading the book and diving deeper into this subject.
