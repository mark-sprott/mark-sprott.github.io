        So far I have found the EDA experience very similar to firefighting in the sense that its exciting and scary all at the same time.  And like firefighting it’s very hard if not impossible to do by yourself (it’s a lot more fun with your friends, trust me).
        I love the campus in Wellington, the people are so friendly and make you feel really welcome.  Especially Jack and Harrison!
        The culture of EDA for me was the main reason for choosing to attend this program.  It’s open, warm and very encouraging.  Which is a big help when you hit brick walls (and you do hit them).
        My expectations have changed since starting at EDA.  However, I think it’s more about what I now expect of myself in terms of what I think I can achieve while at EDA.
        As far as a learning environment goes, I think EDA has really hit the nail on the head here, and can see this type of learning in more institutions in the future.
