      <h3>
        Analogy to describe HTML, CSS and DOM so that anyone can understand
      </h3>
      <p>
        I actually liked the way that Udacity explained HTML using the construction of a house or building to describe how each element works.  So I will use a similar analogy, however mine will be a book case.  HTML is like the bookcase itself i.e. the wooden sides and the selves.  CSS is the colour of the bookcase and the style i.e. large or small shelves, long or short.
      </p>
      <p>
        I came across this analogy to describe the DOM on the net and thought it was fantastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine that you are a delivery person and need to drop off several packages to a neighbourhood.  Inside the neighbourhood, there are 7 streets and 73 houses and you have 5 packages.  There are 2 ways that you can make your deliveries.
      </p>
      <li>
        1) Have a description of the house you are looking for.'The blue house with the name Smith on the mailbox'.
      </li>
      <li>
        2) Having an address book with all the addresses to the houses.
      </li>
      <p>
        obviously, option 2 would be more efficient.  The DOM is the 'address book' for the webpage.
