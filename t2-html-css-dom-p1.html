      <h2>
        Analogy to describe HTML, CSS and DOM so that anyone can understand...Hopefully
      </h2>
      <p>
        I actually liked the way that Udacity explained HTML using the construction of a house or building to describe how each element works.  So I will use a similar analogy, however mine will be a book case.  HTML is like the bookcase itself i.e. the wooden sides and the selves.  CSS is the colour of the bookcase and the style i.e. large or small shelves, long or short.
      </p>
      <p>
        I came across this analogy to describe the DOM on the net and thought it was fantastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine that you are a delivery person and need to drop off several packages to a neighbourhood.  Inside the neighbourhood, there are 7 streets and 73 houses and you have 5 packages.  There are 2 ways that you can make your deliveries.
      </p>
      <li>
        1) Have a description of the house you are looking for.'The blue house with the name Smith on the mailbox'.
      </li>
      <li>
        2) Having an address book with all the addresses to the houses.
      </li>
      <p>
        obviously, option 2 would be more efficient.  The DOM is the 'address book' for the webpage.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What is boxifying design?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every thing on a web page is contained in a box.  Boxifying design means that every element of a web page is divided into box.  Take this page for an example, the whole page could be one box and then inside that box we have another for the picture and another for the text.  We can also break the text down into more boxes, like the headings can be in another box.  I like to think of the web page as a grid made up of squares and you can place a box in each square or over mulitple squares, you keep doing this until all the content that you want on your web page in neatly contained with in the grid.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h2>
        What is the box model?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Now you know that everything on a web page is contained in boxes, that's good.  But what if you need a bigger box?  Or what if you need more room for your boxes?
      </p>
      <p>
      So there are several area's inside and outside the boxes that we can change or manipulate.
     </p>
     <li>
       Content: the things you wish to place in a box, like text.
     </li>
     <li>
       Padding: the space between the content (text) and the border of the box.
     </li>
     <li>
